# MusicMan
React Webapp to view and create Spotify playlists.

To start webapp locally, run `cd music-man && npm start`

If npm start does not use localhost:3000 there will be problems with the redirection from Spotify's Authentication API

Future Work:
- Get and store user data in order to call Spotify API with user codes to view and create playlists
- Add new fun ways to create new playlists
